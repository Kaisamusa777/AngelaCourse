method is a function associated with an object

it usualy comes after the variable. 
Example: 

bellBoy1.moveSuitcase(); // this is a method
audio.play();

difference between method and properties are the parenthesis



function myFunction(filelocation){
    this.fileLocation = fileLocation;

    creaitng your own method

this.myMethod = function(){

    console.log("this is my methond);
}


}

var myObject = new Object();
myObject.myMethod();
