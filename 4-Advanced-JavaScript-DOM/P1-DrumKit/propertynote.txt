    name:musa,
    age:11,
    student:true,
    language: ["Arabic", "English", "French"]
}
alert("Hello, my name is " + worker1.name);



Creating a Factory for properties make life easier, such as: 


below is a constructor function, which name has to be capitalized.
It takes number of inputs 
also the function is assigned to the properties

function BellBoy(name, age, hashWorkerPermit, languages){
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.hashWorkerPermit = hashWorkerPermit;
    this.languages = languages;


}

initialise Object 

var bellBoy1 = new BellBoy("Timmy", 19,true, ["French", "English"])
